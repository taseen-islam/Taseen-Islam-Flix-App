### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Last week I had no more space left on my laptop so I had to buy an external SSD, which made my submission late. After the SSD arrived, I spent over 10 hours just to get XCode to work. My IDE views would be completely black with elements having blue outlines. I asked for help in the CodePath slack but couldn't get any. After trying every solution in dozens of StackOverflow and Apple Developer threads, I had to let go and take the no submission. After a few days of thinking about what I could do, I finally found the solution and am now submitting the completed Flix app. This week's work went extremely fast after I fixed my IDE, but I spent a really long time last week trying to get XCode to properly work. I am glad though because now I can continue to learn and submit work without errors and can continue to be a part of CodePath.
